Date,Highlights,Details,Next Steps
2/25/2019,Started interfacing pulse oximeter sensors available in the lab,Using Arduino UNO and MAX3501 Pulse Oximeter,Develop Arduino program for sensor control and data acquisition and transfer
,Started sketching sensor holder prototype:,,
,,Forehead design,3D Design and printing of designs
,,Neck design,
,"Started building the data gathering, communication central","Python script, uses MQTT",Develop Python program for data transfer and logging
,,,Order parts as listed in proposal
,,,
3/26/2019,Continued interfacing pulse oximeter sensors available in the lab,Using Arduino UNO and MAX3501 Pulse Oximeter,Sensor does not seem to be performing as desired/expected
,,Using the PulseSensor from World Famous Electronics,"Sensor performs on the Arduino, now adapting to the ESP32"
,"Tested heart rate sensor for forehead, neck and earlobe",PulseSensor performs in every scenario,Build fixtures
,Started design of three fixture models,"Modelus are specific to forehead, neck, and earlobe","Will print models and test fixing to sensors, components"
